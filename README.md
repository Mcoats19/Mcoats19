# Hi there, I'm Martineja! 👋  

## 🌟 About Me
![Customer Success](https://img.shields.io/badge/Customer_Success-Expert-blueviolet)

I'm a Technical Customer Success Manager passionate about helping organizations scale their data and AI initiatives through powerful, open-source technologies. I specialize in bridging the gap between business outcomes and technical implementation — translating strategy into measurable success.  

At the intersection of **Customer Success, Data Science, and DevOps**, I empower enterprise teams to build confidently, automate workflows, and drive adoption of platforms like **Posit (formerly RStudio)**, **GitLab**, and **Dataiku**.  

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring emerging tech, mentoring early-career professionals in CS and analytics, and building small creative projects that blend design, storytelling, and automation.
